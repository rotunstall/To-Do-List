I am a web technologist with 10+ years of experience primarily in WordPress them design and development. My goal is to transition into a position were I can leverage my experience and acquired knowledge in the area of JavaScript based front-end web development, while continuing to grow on my journey to become senior developer in the field.

I believe in a strong fundamental development foundation based on sound  accessible HTML, CSS and JavaScript principles, while also providing clients/stakeholders the benefits of modern proven development features and practices. It is always worth doing it right.
