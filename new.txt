I am a web technologist with 10+ years of experience primarily in WordPress theme design and development. My objective is to transition into a position were I can leverage my experience and acquired knowledge in the area of JavaScript based front-end web development as a skilled jr. developer, who has an eagerness to learn.

I believe in a strong fundamental development foundation based on sound accessible HTML, creative CSS and efficient JavaScript principles, while also providing clients/stakeholders the benefits of modern proven development features and practices. By putting in the extra time and effort to continuously develop and grow my technical abilities, my goal is to improve and enrich every professional environment I am fortunate to work in as well as each individual project I am fortunate to be apart of. It is always worth doing it right.
